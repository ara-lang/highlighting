# Ara Highlighting

Ara Programming Language Syntax Highlighting for Visual Studio Code ðŸ–Œ

> **Note:** This extension is still in development and is not yet ready for use.

## Notes for contributors

### What's in the folder

* `syntaxes/ara.json` - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization.
* `language-configuration.json` - this is the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.

### Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with the extension loaded.
* Create a new file with a file name suffix `.ara`.
* Verify that syntax highlighting works and that the language configuration settings are working.

### Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.
